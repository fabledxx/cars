### Installation
Please refer to the [Unity ML Agents repository.](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) Current version of RoboLeague uses [ML-Agents Release 11](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/release_11)

### Completed features (identical to Rocket League)
* Ball physics (ground / wall bounces, friction model, gravity, etc)
* Car aerial control and physics
* Acceleration and braking on the ground
* Single jump mechanics
* Sticky forces

### Planned features
* OpenAI gym interface integration. [Unity ML already provides a wrapper](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/gym-unity)
* Car ball interaction
* Dodges and second jump
* Stabilizing moment near the ground
* Lateral friction model as in the game (ratio between Vx/Vy)
